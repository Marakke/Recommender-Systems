## How to Run the Program

### Using Docker 
1. Open the terminal at the root directory of this project. 
2. Start the Docker daemon (also known as the Docker application). 
3. Run the following command:  
```docker-compose up```
4. This command will build and run the project, executing each weekly assignment. You will see the process and outputs in your terminal.  
 
### Using Python Pip 
1. Open a terminal in the directory where you wish to run the program. 
2. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:    
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
3. After the dependencies are installed, execute the program with:    
```python assignment.py```
4. The program will run, and the results will be displayed in the terminal. 

# Cosine Similarity in Collaborative Filtering

We chose coisine similarity function for the part E of the assignment.

The cosine similarity gives a useful measure of how similar two objects are. It is a rather simple mathematical concept and easy to implement computationally. The cosine similarity is a versatile and effective similarity metric for collaborative filtering, especially in scenarios involving sparse and high-dimensional data.
