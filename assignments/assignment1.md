# How to run the code

The code can be run either via Docker or via PIP.

1. Docker

With Docker installed, typing "docker compose up" in terminal will run the code.

2. PIP

First, install the libraries by typing "pip install -r requirements.txt" to the terminal.
Then, typing "python assignment1" in the assignment1 directory will run the code.

The assignment results will be printed out to the console.

# Cosine Similarity in Collaborative Filtering

We chose coisine similarity function for the part E of the assignment.

The cosine similarity gives a useful measure of how similar two objects are. It is a rather simple mathematical concept and easy to implement computationally. The cosine similarity is a versatile and effective similarity metric for collaborative filtering, especially in scenarios involving sparse and high-dimensional data.
